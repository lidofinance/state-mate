state-mate is a simple tool that validates contracts' states against a concise YAML-based description. Run state-mate to verify deploy outcome, current state, access control and more.

state-mate accepts a yaml file that includes contract addresses, view functions and their expected results. It calls each function and compares the output to the expected result.

## ✨ Features

- state (non-mutable functions result) verification,
- automatically validates that all functions covered,
- supports any EVM network,
- easily configurable checks,
- CI-friendly,
- uses yaml config (env variables, variables, comments).

## ⚡ Getting started

### Requirements

- git
- Node.js >=20,
- yarn

### Usage

1. Install dependencies

```sh
yarn install
```

2. Specify RPC endpoints for your target networks, e.g.

```sh
export L1_RPC_URL=%YOUR_RPC_URL%
export L2_RPC_URL=%YOUR_RPC_URL%
```

3. Start the program

```sh
yarn start path/to/config.yaml
```

### Configuration

Config is a yaml file that contains all the required addresses, parameters, view functions with their expected results for verification. The outline of the config is given below,

```yaml
# Sample config

parameters:
  # List of parameters
  - &MY_PARAMETER 42

misc:
  # Misc variables
  - &FOO "foo"

deployed:
  # Contract addresses
  - &myContract "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
  - &adminMultisig "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000002"

roles:
  # ACL checks
  - &DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"

l1:
  rpcUrl: L1_RPC_URL # env variable
  contracts:
    myContract:
      name: "myContract"
      address: *myContract
      implementation: "%implementation address%"
      proxyChecks:
        proxy__getAdmin: *adminMultisig
      checks:
        # list of view functions and expected results
        getMyParameter: *MY_PARAMETER
        getFoo: *FOO
      ozAcl:
        *DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE : [*adminMultisig]
```

### ABIs

All requried ABIs must be located in the same directory as the config and placed under `abi` folder. See [configs](/configs/).
